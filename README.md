####Task: 
To write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL and then use that code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

I made a few of my own interpretations and instead of hard-coding instances, I got the user to input the title of their favourite movies and then get its details using the [Open Movies Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and its trailer from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

####Requirements:
    pip install bs4
    run movie_list.py
